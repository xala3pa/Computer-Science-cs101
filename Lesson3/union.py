# Define a procedure, union,
# that takes as inputs two lists.
# It should modify the first input
# list to be the set union of the two
# lists. You may assume the first list
# is a set, that is, it contains no 
# repeated elements.

# To test, uncomment all lines 
# below except those beginning with >>>.
